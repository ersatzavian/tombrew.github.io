    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About a month ago, I connected a 24-pixel Neopixel Ring to the Internet and got it to play little animations to show weather conditions.</p>

<p>Right away, I had other ideas for what I could do with it. So I figured an experiment was in order. I&rsquo;d put up an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/NeoWeather-Ambient-Weather-Indicator/">instructable on how to build it</a>, and see what else people could get it to do. By the end of day one, my friend <a href="https://github.com/blindman2k">Aron Steg</a> had already written a <a href="https://github.com/electricimp/reference/tree/master/hardware/ws2812/examples/packagetracker">package tracker</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD1yLFayQvQ">clock app</a> for it.</p>

<p>Since the experiment was going well, I thought I&rsquo;d put all the different things people programmed their little 24-pixel dials to do with the Internet up on a blog. The only trouble is, I keep meeting people doing even more amazing things, and I already know I&rsquo;m going to cave and want to share some of it. So here are my field notes.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s going to be tech stuff, and non-tech stuff, and opinions, and all the usual. <a href="https://twitter.com/tlbyrn">Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; on  Twitter</a> if you&rsquo;ve got something that should maybe be included.</p>
