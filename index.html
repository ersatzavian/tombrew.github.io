		<p>In late March, I had the privelege of being invited to mentor teams at <a href="http://pearlhacks.com/">PearlHacks</a>, a women-only hackathon at UNC Chapel Hill. This was the very first PearlHacks, and it went really well. I go to a fair number of hackathons because of work, but this one was different in a some pretty important ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Creativity</strong>. The ideas started flying the instant a new tool was introduced. Typically, I see developers and engineers react to new tools and ideas by trying to find ways to shoot them down. This was the opposite.</li>
<li><strong>Confidence</strong>. These engineers and students went straight from the drawing board to the workbench. Again, I&rsquo;m used to hearing &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a hardware person&rdquo;/&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a software person&rdquo;. These developers, in this environment, didn&rsquo;t spend time telling themselves that parts of their project were opaque or impossible to them. Instead, they hit Google, asked questions, and tried things. And they got it done.</li>
<li><strong>Community</strong>. Especially in a competitive environment, it&rsquo;s not a surprise to see a team belittle another team&rsquo;s work to bring themselves up. I do this sometimes, even though I think it&rsquo;s awful. There was absolutely none of this at PearlHacks.</li>
</ol>


<p>I may have been there to mentor, but I learned a lot. Here&rsquo;s a quick look at two of the teams I got to hack with over the weekend and what they built:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/jennyxing27">Jenny Xing</a> built a <a href="https://github.com/jennyxing27/Neopixel-Circle-Stop">real-world version</a> of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/circle-stop/id728614805?mt=8">Circle Stop</a>, an iOS game by <a href="http://www.twentypercentgames.com/">Twenty Percent Games</a>. I was especially floored when I saw it because Circle Stop was built my friend <a href="http://www.twentypercentgames.com/about/">Nolan Filter</a>. It&rsquo;s a small world! Jenny won Best Hardware Hack and got a kit from Sparkfun for her project.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Gloria Li and Fay Wu built a battery-powered, internet-connected silent alarm, and won 2nd place for their project. They definitely deserved the recognition &ndash; in 24 hours, they tackled the challenge of building a battery-powered, internet-connected device; learning a new programming language and style (The &ldquo;Squirrel&rdquo; language used by Electric Imp is <a href="http://electricimp.com/docs/resources/eventprogramming/">event-driven</a>, which can be really challenging at first); making it compact, and integrating with <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs">Twilio</a>. By morning, they had a device that could sent a text or an automated phone call at the touch of a button.</li>
</ul>

<p>PearlHacks was awesome, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to using what I learned there to try and help run better events and to be a better engineer. Thanks, PearlHacks!</p>

			Let&#8217;s Give This a Try</a>
	</h2>
	<div class="entry-content">
		<p>About a month ago, I connected a 24-pixel Neopixel Ring to the Internet and got it to play little animations to show weather conditions.</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/2014-04-02-lets-give-this-a-try/neoweather.png" width="300" height="300"></p>

<p>Right away, I had other ideas for what I could do with it. So I figured an experiment was in order. I&rsquo;d put up an <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/NeoWeather-Ambient-Weather-Indicator/">instructable on how to build it</a>, and see what else people could get it to do. By the end of day one, my friend <a href="https://github.com/blindman2k">Aron Steg</a> had already written a <a href="https://github.com/electricimp/reference/tree/master/hardware/ws2812/examples/packagetracker">package tracker</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD1yLFayQvQ">clock app</a> (<a href="https://gist.github.com/blindman2k/10023960">code here</a>) for it.</p>

<p>Since the experiment was going well, I thought I&rsquo;d put all the different things people programmed their little 24-pixel dials to do with the Internet up on a blog. The only trouble is, I keep meeting people doing even more amazing things, and I already know I&rsquo;m going to cave and want to share some of it. So here are my field notes.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s going to be tech stuff, and non-tech stuff, and opinions, and all the usual. <a href="https://twitter.com/tlbyrn">Say &ldquo;hi&rdquo; on  Twitter</a> if you&rsquo;ve got something that should maybe be included.</p>
